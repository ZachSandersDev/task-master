# Task Master
> A really simple automation tool for making Node.js scripts into commands

## Usage: 

- #### `tm new` or `tm new <task name>`
  Creates a new package and registers the entered name as a task 

- #### `tm remove` or `tm remove <task name>`  
  Deletes an existing task and its folder

- #### `tm edit` or `tm edit <task name>`
  Opens a task's folder (specifically in vscode for now)
  
  Here, you can write whatever you want and have it be instantly available as a command in the terminal
- #### `tm <task name>`
  Runs a task you've created!
